# Monolithic Systems 
 
Monolithic Systems are systems that are built as a single unit. In other words, if you are changing one part of the system and you have to build and deploy the entire system again, you are dealing with a monolithic system. It is a single deployable unit.

Additionally, there are several controversies about monolithic systems, like that they are outdated, hard to maitain, and hard to scale. However, monolithic systems are still widely used and are a good choice for many applications. It is just a matter of taking the right decisions when building your system.

## When using a monolit might be a good idea?

- When working on a new project where the business requirements are not clear yet;
- When the core business logic is not well defined and unstable;
- When you want to avoid complexity related to deploying and managing multiple services;
- When you have a small team and you want to avoid operational overhead;
